This is a basic sketchpad written entirely in vanilla JavaScript. It has 3 drawing modes and the ability to set your own number of squares per side. 

You can play around with it here: lennythedude.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

Creating this sketchpad helped me practice my JS fundamentals as well as try out & better understand DOM manipulation.
